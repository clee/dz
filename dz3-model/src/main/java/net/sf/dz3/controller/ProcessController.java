 * VT: FIXME: Think about how to make this work nicely with {@link DataSource} and {@link DataSink} entities.
 * Controllers normally have one source of input data. DZ3 implementation, so far, doesn't have
 * consumers that feed from more than one process controller that need to be distinguished other than by signature.
