### WE'VE MOVED

The main Home Climate Control script is now generated by running `./gradlew installDist`
from top level project directory, and will be then located at

`./dz3-spring/build/install/dz/bin/dz`

Without arguments, it will try to read configuration from
`raspberry-pi.xml` file in the current directory (or at the specified path).

**IMPORTANT**: previously the command line argument specified classpath, now
it is a filesystem location.

### NEXT STEPS

Go to https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/wiki for further
instructions.

### BEFORE YOU GO

A few useful scripts in this directory:

* `pack-and-clear-logs` - what it says. Look inside to fine tune how long
  the logs are kept.

* `raise-priority` - if you feel that DZ doesn't get enough CPU.

* `take-memory-dump` - will come handy if you think there's a memory leak.
  Take subsequent snapshots as far apart as possible to get an accurate
  picture, the first preferably right after startup.

* `take-thread-stack-dump` - will come handy if you think there's a deadlock
  or a livelock.
